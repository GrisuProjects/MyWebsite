              <p>
                I love to code. It is an absolutely meaningfull skill, espacially in our modern world. And it is more than only a meaningfull skill, it is the kind of thinking that embraces one. The way one understands the world changes... And that is what life is about. Being human trying to understand the bigger picture.
              </p>
              <p>
                Joining the idea that together we can create communities that do not suck and do things that just let the happiness spread out. That's what I am into:

                This is all about sharing(sounds generic and dull... but true). Nothing works without it - and that's great.

                Communities spread out like crazy and there is more awesomeness around every single day. I am very pleased to see more and more people go crazy at what they're doin'. And making progress at the speed of light(literally). I wanna be
