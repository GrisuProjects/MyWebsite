            What an insane year! So many things to say... <br />
            A lot of progress was being made and it it seems like it does not stop here. Some preview text will be displayed here to provide a little insight into the monthly articles. Maybe these articles will be used to summ up everything that happened this month, going from software over to myself and so on.

                      Completely developed by myself it is a sort of playground for me and kinda will be an information source in feauture(maybe). I have big planns with it as it will also contain not only information about me, it will also contain informations about other projects that are running.

            I believe in good things comming. And therefore it is a good idea to start right here. In the last couple of weeks and months happened so many unbelieveable things and that strengthened me in what I do and even more important what I want to do. In terms of sorftware development that means that I want to learn as much as I can and then write software that is free and open and benefits everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am so amazed about what I got to in the past few weeks. I spend much time on the internet to study various programming languages and it is overwhelming what there already is on free information from people who really like what they are doing and just want everyone to benefit from it.
