                I love programming in general and want to learn as much as I can so I can contribute back to all the amazing people out there who have a helping hand for people like me. All my knowledge comes from helping hands... and that is what makes us humans, isn't it?
              </p>
              <p>
                I have big dreams and really want to make them come true and as it looks right now I am on the right way of doing this. Hopefully this site gets revamped a lot of times since then and hopefully I get in contact with the greatness of the world.

                        Completely developed by myself it is a sort of playground for me and kinda will be an information source in feauture(maybe). I have big planns with it as it will also contain not only information about me, it will also contain informations about other projects that are running.

              <p>
                I believe in good things comming. And therefore it is a good idea to start right here. In the last couple of weeks and months happened so many unbelieveable things and that strengthened me in what I do and even more important what I want to do. In terms of sorftware development that means that I want to learn as much as I can and then write software that is free and open and benefits everyone.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am so amazed about what I got to in the past few weeks. I spend much time on the internet to study various programming languages and it is overwhelming what there already is on free information from people who really like what they are doing and just want everyone to benefit from it.
