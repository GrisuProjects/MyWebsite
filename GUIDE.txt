This guide will bring you through all my coding standards and my modularity system. It wants to help anybody who wants to distribute and/or learn from my creations and is part of every repository I make.
It will teach you the idea behind things I made as short as possible (Iam am sure you wanna code as fast as possible :). So let's start right in:

THE SYNTHAX

  Short indroduction into my synthax

  * No leading spaces
  * Use blank lines to indicate blocks of related code

  CSS/SCSS

    * Use spaces as indentations, not tabs
    * Use two spaces for indentation
    * Make spaces before {} and after :
    * Use enough lines, don't squeeze too many things in one line
      - Example

        body {
          font-size: 100%;
        }


  HTML

    * Use spaces as indentations, not tabs
    * Use two spaces for indentation
    * After large related blocks of code make an empty line
    * Use enough lines, don't squeeze too many things in one line
      - Example

      <p>
        Some text.
      </p>


  JavaScript

    * Use spaces as indentations, not tabs
    * Use four spaces for indentation
    * For all rules submit your file to jslint.com or look at my JS file
      - Example



  THE STRUCTURE

    There are some rules I came up with that I use to make my code as readable and maintainable as possible.

    * There is always a copyright notice on top of each file.

    CSS/SCSS

      * The code is divided into sections to make it better to read and understand
        - There are 4 major ones

          ) General tag declarations (without any classes or ids)
            - like body, h2, a, ...
            - NOT: .class, #id, .class h2, ...

          ) header section
          ) main section
          ) footer section

        The last three of the sections mentioned above are separated in the inex.scss file with the @import rule to make it more readable.
