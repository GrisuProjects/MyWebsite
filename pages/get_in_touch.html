            <h2>How to contact me?</h2>
            <p>
              First of all, I do not get the point right now why I should be on social media, and, that is why you will not find me anywhere around. But we can be thankful that god not only built the web on top of the internet but he also made it possible to send E-Mails!
            </p>
            <p>
              As you could probably hear that sarcasm it is true that I have an E-Mail account. Yes... I admit.
            </p>
            <p>
              And as you probably have noticed, that this site is published on GitHub, and as you can think of right now, you can also find me on GitHub! That is great news for you as if you have any troubles, want to contribute or have any suggestions, Github is the right place to start.
            </p>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
              You can contact me in these two ways:
              <ul>
                <li><a href="mailto:crisscross.kaindl@outlook.de">E-Mail</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.github.com/GrisuProjects/">GitHub</a></li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              Hope I could help ya, and now... I go my way and you yours.
            </p>
